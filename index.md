- Authored a number of use-cases to remove the use of SharePoint, Excel, Macros, network directories & emails as manual business operations

-	Integrated with key COE web services (OSA, Acc etc) from the cloud service registry resulting in efficient middleware deployment & showcasing cloud registry re-usability for other departments to follow

-	Solved key architectural issues of complex relationships between multi-level business processing, hierarchical process maps, multi-user-roles, approver/reviewer controls across business units etc

-	Designed RESTful Web Services to automate 21 out of 83 business process steps of global ETF processing and & coded respective extract results onto BPM dashboard

-	Directed the development of respective modules thru various offshore factories of India, China & Europe with a team of 19 members including team leads

#  From 26 Hours to 2: Re-Architecting Payment Settlement at Scale

In a recent platform optimization initiative, we tackled a batch settlement job that was taking over **26 hours** to process millions of payment transactions. The goal: reduce latency, improve scalability, and enable real-time visibility across verticals.

##  The Bottleneck

Initially, batches were split **by client**, with each client’s transactions processed sequentially. This created uneven load distribution and limited parallelism. Worse, transactions were queued **by state** (e.g., authorized, pending), requiring full context before processing—slowing throughput and complicating retries.

##  The Breakthrough

We re-architected the flow by:

- Splitting files by **transaction objects** (e.g., payment info, authorization, metadata)
- Queuing objects independently, regardless of transaction state
- Linking all objects via a unique **TID (Transaction ID)**
- Updating transaction state dynamically as objects arrived

This allowed the system to process components in parallel, update transaction records incrementally, and mark them as **Settled** once all required objects were present.

##  New Flow Architecture
Batch File → Split by Objects → Drop into Queue → Process Independently → Link by TID → Update State → Mark as Settled


| Step                  | Benefit                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Object-level splitting| Enables granular parallelism             |
| Stateless queuing     | Removes dependency on full context       |
| TID-based linking     | Supports dynamic state transitions       |
| Event-driven updates  | Enables real-time settlement             |

## 📈 Results

- ⏱ **Processing time** dropped from 26 hours to **under 2 hours**
- 💸 Processed **$129M+** across **7.2M transactions** at **1800 tps**
- ⚙️ Enabled **horizontal scalability** and **object-level retries**
- 📊 Improved visibility for vertical-specific dashboards

##  Strategic Impact

This shift from client-centric batching to **object-driven, event-based processing** unlocked performance and resilience. It’s a model that scales across verticals—education, healthcare, travel etc., where transaction complexity and compliance vary.
