### GLOBAL MODEL OFFICE DASHBOARD (BPM) 

Business Process Outsourcing and ‘follow-the-sun’ operations across 26 countries created the need to have a management control dashboard and alerts in real-time. My role was to automate the global business operations of ‘internal controls compliance’ and scale them into cloud services as well as provide BPM dashboard for largest ETF clients in the industry

•	Introduced a multi-phased system design to reach the future-state architecture aligning with efficient use of resources and private-cloud roadmap

•	Authored a number of use-cases to remove the use of SharePoint, Excel, Macros, network directories & emails as manual business operations

•	Integrated with key COE web services (OSA, Acc etc) from the cloud service registry resulting in efficient middleware deployment & showcasing cloud registry re-usability for other departments to follow

•	Solved key architectural issues of complex relationships between multi-level business processing, hierarchical process maps, multi-user-roles, approver/reviewer controls across business units etc

•	Designed RESTful Web Services to automate 21 out of 83 business process steps of global ETF processing and & coded respective extract results onto BPM dashboard

•	Directed the development of respective modules thru various offshore factories of India, China & Europe with a team of 19 members including team leads

•	Automation of ICT (Internal Controls Testing) resulted in 66% of ops support cost

### Global Compliance Processing System: (Enterprise Product)  

Architected, designed, and implemented a single unified highly scalable compliance offering for the enterprise by consolidating many different products (Mig21, CRD plus internal apps) across multiple divisions, departments & geographical locations. Some of my accomplishments include

•	Synthesized various data sources into manageable feeds and leveraged enterprise FDR (Financial data repository) for global scalability

•	Systemized the 40act funds and standard reporting clients into CRD database enabling efficient and simplified support by Offshore

•	Evangelized the use of Mig21 Data Manager as a conduit for Bloomberg VR, Simcorp Dimension, Client feeds and European data layers of the enterprise

•	Programmed the core engine (Tranche Web) Processing for scaling Data Availability of funds to various business units as per the client SLA needs

•	Fortified gap analysis & business rules thru various phases of CRD & Mig21 deployments and client on-boarding

•	Implemented a POC on the new architecture and logged the performance and scalability results with Office of Architecture resulting in the go-approval from mgmt. on this initiative

• Initiated a pilot ‘innovation’ program for BigData by utilizing IBM Watson’s computational intelligence for issuer credit worthiness as part of credit default compliance resulting in a multi-year project to integrate self-service business data and gold-copy data
